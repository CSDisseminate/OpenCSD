Hello!

We’ve got some exciting news: OpenCSD and CSDisseminate are joining forces and becoming one working group! Our mission is still the same: to spread the word about open science in communication sciences and disorders (CSD). But now we’re doing it together.

### Why the merge?

CSDisseminate started during the pandemic as a way to raise awareness about self-archiving. Over time, we felt proud of that work but also wanted to branch out and talk about other open science practices like sharing open data, preregistration, registered reports, open educational resources, and more. That’s what led to the creation of **OpenCSD**.

But, the truth is we’re all volunteers, doing this work as a side passion project. And in the past few years, life has been *busy*. Many of us have gone through big transitions—finishing PhDs, starting postdocs or faculty roles, having babies—and we realized that trying to run two separate projects just didn’t make sense anymore.

We’re more effective (and have more fun) when we work together.

### So what’s new?

We’re merging under the name **CSDisseminate**, with a fresh coat of purple paint and a renewed commitment to making open science more accessible in our field. We’ll be tackling a broader range of topics moving forward—and first up is one we’re especially excited about: sharing open data.
